## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added
- In-app update mechanism: an admin can check for, install, and roll back
  tagged releases from the Settings page (see `updater.py` and the
  Updates section of Settings) without touching the command line. Updates
  are downloaded from GitHub Releases, backed up against first, installed
  into their own isolated environment, health-checked on a throwaway
  port, and only then switched to — a failed update never takes the
  clinic offline. This is the first version tracked through that
  mechanism, so it establishes the starting point rather than describing
  new clinic-facing behavior.
